## Introduction

### Objective

This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system using data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. By applying Python-based machine learning techniques, the system will analyze user preferences and suggest relevant movies. The goal is to create a personalized, efficient recommendation system that enhances content discovery for users.

### Motivation

In today's digital entertainment world, users are overwhelmed with content options, making personalized recommendations more essential than ever. Recommendation systems help by offering tailored suggestions, which improves user engagement and satisfaction. With platforms like Netflix and Hulu relying on data-driven algorithms, effective recommendation systems are crucial to enhancing viewer experience. Using data from an API like TMDb, which includes extensive movie data, allows for more accurate and relevant content suggestions. This allows for a more engaging and relevant user experience, fostering deeper interaction with the platform and greater satisfaction with the recommendations provided.

### **Methodology**

The movie recommendation system is implemented using Python and relies on data extracted from The Movie Database (TMDb) API to ensure access to the most up-to-date movie information. The system follows a hybrid approach using the cascade method, where content-based filtering is applied first to narrow down the dataset. This step filters movies based on their features, such as genres and other content-based movie information, to identify those similar to a user’s interests.

Once the dataset is refined, the filtered results are passed into the collaborative filtering script, which further analyzes patterns in user interactions to generate the final recommendations. By combining these two approaches, the system enhances recommendation accuracy and ensures that users receive relevant movie suggestions tailored to their preferences.

### Data Description

As aforementioned, the data is obtained using TMDb API. The data is extracted into two separate DataFrames, one content-based and one collaborative-based. The content-based DataFrame, `movie_content_df`, after undergoing all preprocessing and cleaning, includes the following variables: `movie_id`, `title`, `release_year`, `genre_ids`, `original_language`, `cast_names`, `watch_providers`, `rating_average`, and `vote_count`. The collaborative-based DataFrame, `movie_reviews_df`, after undergoing all preprocessing and cleaning, includes the following variables: `movie_id`, `user_rating`, and `user_id`.

### API Data Retrieval

To use the TMDb API, users must create an account on [The Movie Database website](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and generate a personal authentication key. This key is required to authenticate API requests and obtain data. Content-based filtering and collborative-based filtering have their own respective data retrieval scripts. Both retrieval scripts include a delay between requests to avoid hitting TMDb's rate limit.

#### Content-based filtering

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Loading necessary packages
import requests
import pandas as pd
import time

api_key = "d3e8d7fcb94be031986259192b4fdfb0"

# Base URLs
url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular"
credits_url_template = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{}/credits"
providers_url_template = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{}/watch/providers"

# Number of pages to retrieve
total_pages = 200
all_movies = []

# Fetch popular movies
for page in range(1, total_pages + 1):
    parameters = {"api_key": api_key, "page": page}
    response = requests.get(url, params=parameters)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        movies = data["results"]
        
        for movie in movies:
            movie["movie_id"] = movie.pop("id")  # Rename 'id' to 'movie_id'
            movie["rating_average"] = movie.pop("vote_average")  # Rename 'vote_average' to 'rating_average'
            
            # Get cast names
            credits_url = credits_url_template.format(movie["movie_id"])
            credits_response = requests.get(credits_url, params={"api_key": api_key})
            if credits_response.status_code == 200:
                credits_data = credits_response.json()
                cast_names = {cast_member["name"] for cast_member in credits_data.get("cast", [])} 
                movie["cast_names"] = ", ".join(cast_names)  
            else:
                movie["cast_names"] = None
            
            # Get watch providers
            providers_url = providers_url_template.format(movie["movie_id"])
            providers_response = requests.get(providers_url, params={"api_key": api_key})
            if providers_response.status_code == 200:
                providers_data = providers_response.json()
                provider_names = set()  # Store unique provider names
                
                for region, provider_info in providers_data.get("results", {}).items():
                    for category, providers_list in provider_info.items():
                        if isinstance(providers_list, list):
                            provider_names.update(provider["provider_name"] for provider in providers_list)
                
                movie["watch_providers"] = ", ".join(provider_names)
            else:
                movie["watch_providers"] = None
            
            time.sleep(0.2)  # Short delay to avoid rate limiting
        
        all_movies.extend(movies)
    else:
        print("Error:", response.status_code)
    
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(page)
    
# Convert to DataFrame
movie_content_df = pd.DataFrame(all_movies)
```

The system queries the following TMDb API endpoints to gather relevant movie data:

-   General Movie Metadata (`/movie/popular`, `/movie/{movie_id}`)

    -   Retrieves a list of popular movies with their movie identification numbers, movie titles, genres, release dates, languages, and voting/popularity information.

-   Cast Information (`/movie/{movie_id}/credits`)

    -   Extracts key actors from each movie.

-   Watch Providers (`movie/{movie_id}/watch/providers`)

    -   Obtains a list of all available streaming service platforms for each movie.

#### Collaborative-based filtering

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Load necessary packages
import requests
import pandas as pd
import time

api_key = "d3e8d7fcb94be031986259192b4fdfb0"

# Base URLs
popular_movies_url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular"
reviews_url_template = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{}/reviews"

# Number of pages to retrieve
total_pages = 200 
all_movies = []

# Fetch popular movies
for page in range(1, total_pages + 1):
    response = requests.get(popular_movies_url, params={"api_key": api_key, "page": page})
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        movies = response.json().get("results", [])
        all_movies.extend(movies)
    else:
        print("Error:", response.status_code)
        break

    time.sleep(0.5)  # Prevent rate-limiting
    print(page)

# Convert movies to DataFrame
movies_df = pd.DataFrame(all_movies)

# Fetch reviews for each movie
reviews_data = []

timeout_duration = 0.5

for movie_id in movies_df["id"]:
    response = requests.get(reviews_url_template.format(movie_id), params={"api_key": api_key})
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        reviews = response.json().get("results", [])
        for review in reviews:
            reviews_data.append({
                "movie_id": movie_id,
                "author": review.get("author", "Unknown"),
                "user_rating": review.get("author_details", {}).get("rating", None)  # Changed "rating" to "user_rating"
            })
    else:
        print("Error:", response.status_code)

    time.sleep(0.5)

# Convert reviews to DataFrame
movie_reviews_df = pd.DataFrame(reviews_data)
```

The system queries the following TMDb API endpoints to gather relevant movie data:

-   Popular Movies List (`/movie/popular`)

    -   Retrieves the same list of popular movies that was obtained in the content-based retrieval script, but only extracts movie identification numbers.

-   User Ratings (`/movie/{movie_id}/reviews`)

    -   Collects user-generated movie ratings on a scale from 1-10.

## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

### Content-based filtering

```{python}
# Creates the dictionary of genre IDs and names
# Load necessary packages
import requests
import pandas as pd

api_key = "d3e8d7fcb94be031986259192b4fdfb0"

# Base URL
url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/genre/movie/list"

# Set parameters like the page number and API key
parameters = {
    "api_key": api_key,
    "page":1
}

# Make the GET request to fetch the data
response = requests.get(url, params=parameters)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    genre_data = response.json()  # Convert response to JSON
    genres = genre_data["genres"]  # Extract the list of genres
    genre_dict = {genre["id"]: genre["name"] for genre in genres}  # Create dictionary
    print(genre_dict)  # Print the genre mapping

else:
    print("Error", response.status_code)
```

The first step in preprocessing the content-based data is to create a dictionary that maps the genre identification numbers to its corresponding genre category.

```{python}
# Load necessary packages
import pandas as pd

def preprocessing(dataframe):
    # Map genre_ids to genre names
    dataframe['genre_ids'] = dataframe['genre_ids'].apply(lambda x: [genre_dict[genre_id] for genre_id in x])
    
    # Select columns
    dataframe = dataframe[['movie_id', 'title', 'release_date', 'genre_ids', 'original_language', 'cast_names', 'watch_providers', 'rating_average', 'vote_count']]
    
    return dataframe

# Apply the preprocessing function
movie_content_df = preprocessing(movie_content_df)
```

The code chunk above applies the genre dictionary to extract genre categories. It also retains relevant columns in the DataFrame.

```{python}
# Load necessary packages
import pandas as pd
import pycountry # for languages convertion
import pandas as pd

# Tidying `genre_ids` 
def clean_genre_ids(value):
    if isinstance(value, list):  # If it's already a list, clean and join
        return ', '.join(genre.strip() for genre in value)
    elif isinstance(value, str) and value.startswith('c(') and value.endswith(')'):
        # Handle string cases formatted like R's "c(...)"
        genres = [genre.strip().strip('"') for genre in value[2:-1].split(',')]
        return ', '.join(genres)
    return value  # Return as is if neither case

    # Apply the function to genre_ids column
movie_content_df['genre_ids'] = movie_content_df['genre_ids'].apply(clean_genre_ids)
    # Check genre_ids missing and type
movie_content_df['genre_ids'].isna().sum() # No missing data
movie_content_df['genre_ids'].apply(type).value_counts() # All are string type

# Tidying original language to be full word
def convert_language_code(code):
    try:
        language = pycountry.languages.get(alpha_2=code)
        return language.name
    except:
        return code  # no corresponding language, return original language code
movie_content_df['original_language'] = movie_content_df['original_language'].apply(convert_language_code)
movie_content_df["original_language"] = movie_content_df["original_language"].replace("cn", "Chinese") # cn to Chinese
movie_content_df["original_language"] = movie_content_df["original_language"].replace("xx", "Unknown") # xx to Unknown
    
# Editing data types
movie_content_df['rating_average'] = pd.to_numeric(movie_content_df['rating_average'], errors='coerce')
movie_content_df['rating_average'] = movie_content_df['rating_average'].round(0).astype(int) # vote_average to round
movie_content_df['vote_count'] = pd.to_numeric(movie_content_df['vote_count'], errors='coerce')

# Creating a `release_year` column
movie_content_df = movie_content_df.copy()  # Ensure movies_df is a separate DataFrame
movie_content_df["release_date"] = movie_content_df["release_date"].astype(str)
movie_content_df = movie_content_df[movie_content_df["release_date"] != '']
movie_content_df["release_year"] = pd.to_numeric(movie_content_df["release_date"].str[:4], errors = "coerce")
movie_content_df = movie_content_df.drop(columns=["release_date"])

# Changing the `title` type
  # Convert to pandas' new string type
movie_content_df["title"] = movie_content_df["title"].astype("string")
  # Check the dtype again
print(movie_content_df["title"].dtype)
    
# Editing `cast_names`
movie_content_df["cast_names"] = movie_content_df["cast_names"].replace("", pd.NA)

# Editing `watch_providers`
movie_content_df["watch_providers"] = movie_content_df["watch_providers"].replace("", pd.NA)

# Reordering column names
  # Define the new column order
new_column_order = ['movie_id', 'title', 'release_year', 'genre_ids', 'original_language', 'cast_names', 'watch_providers', 'rating_average', 'vote_count']
  # Reorganize columns in the DataFrame
movie_content_df = movie_content_df[new_column_order]
```

The following edits were made in the code chunk above:

-   `genre_ids` is edited to be a cleaned, comma-separated string

-   `original_language` is edited to display the full name of the language, not the abbreviation

-   `release_year` is created from `release_date` and `release_date` is dropped from the DataFrame

-   `cast_names` and `watch_providers` are edited to replace empty strings with `NA`

-   All columns are checked to ensure correct data types

-   Columns are reordered in the DataFrame for readability

-   Missing values are retained in the DataFrame

### Collaborative-based filtering

```{python}
# Creating a `user_id` column
user_id_map = {}  # Dictionary to store author -> user_id mapping
current_id = 1

# Ensure 'user_id' column exists
movie_reviews_df["user_id"] = pd.NA  

# Get valid indices
valid_indices = movie_reviews_df["user_rating"].notna() & (movie_reviews_df["user_rating"] != "")

# Store user IDs in a list to avoid modifying DataFrame during iteration
user_ids = []

for idx, author in movie_reviews_df.loc[valid_indices, "author"].items():
    if author not in user_id_map:
        user_id_map[author] = current_id
        current_id += 1
    user_ids.append((idx, user_id_map[author]))

# Assign user IDs to the DataFrame
for idx, user_id in user_ids:
    movie_reviews_df.loc[idx, "user_id"] = user_id

# Convert `user_id` to integers (nullable type to allow NaN)
movie_reviews_df["user_id"] = movie_reviews_df["user_id"].astype("Int64")

# Drop the `author` column
movie_reviews_df = movie_reviews_df.drop(columns=["author"])
```

The following edits were made in the code chunk above:

-   `user_id`, a unique identification number, is assigned to each reviewer and is created from `author` and `author` is dropped from the DataFrame

-   Missing values are retained in the DataFrame

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we are focusing on EDA to better understand the data. This is the stage where we are given insights into the structure and characteristics of the data, for instance missing values.

### Variables

```{python}
from prettytable import PrettyTable
table = PrettyTable()
table.field_names = ["Variable Name", "Description"]
table.add_row(['movie_id', 'Unique identifier of the movie.'])
table.add_row(['title', 'Title of the movie.'])
table.add_row(['release_year', 'The year the movie was released.'])
table.add_row(['genre_ids', 'List of genres associated with a movie.'])
table.add_row(['original_language', 'Original language of the movie.'])
table.add_row(['cast_names', 'List of actors in the movie.'])
table.add_row(['watch_providers', 'Streaming platforms where the movie is available.'])
table.add_row(['rating_average', 'A quantitative assessment of the overall quality of a movie.'])
table.add_row(['vote_count', 'The total number of people who voted for the movie.'])
table.add_row(['author', 'Unique identifier for the user.'])
table.add_row(['user_rating', 'Rating given by user.'])
print(table)
```

### Missing Data

![](images/clipboard-1834072139.png){width="307" height="424"}

The dataset `movie_content_df` is missing some observations in `genre_ids`, `cast_names`, and `watch_providers`.

![](images/clipboard-3610589772.png){width="323"}

While in the `movie_reviews_df`, it is missing a majority of `user_rating`.

#### Popular Genres

![](images/clipboard-1866196344.png){width="394"}

About 1600 of movies mention Drama in their genre list. Comedy and Thriller are the next popular genres with approximately 1400 and 1000 counts.

#### Popular Movie Languages

![](images/clipboard-1260077373.png){width="394"}

We can see most of the languages in our dataset have the original language in English with a count of approximately 2,800. The following most popular languages are French and Japanese with a count of approximately 500 and 100.

#### Popular Actors

![](images/clipboard-1337669541.png){width="397"}

As we can see "Jr." is the most common actor in our movie dataset with a count of approximately 85. We do not know who exactly "Jr." is, but we believe the name was cut when retrieving the data. Other actors such as Samuel L. Jackson, and Bruce Willis were also common with a count of approximately 45 and 42.

#### Providers

![](images/clipboard-3952843974.png){width="394"}

Our top providers are 'Apple TV', 'Google Play Movies', and 'Amazon Video'. They offer most of our movies in the dataset, offering approximately 3,000 movies.

#### Reviewers

![](images/clipboard-577182410.png){width="394"}

'CinemaSerf' is our top reviewer, reviewing approximately 300 movies. Following the author, 'r96sk' and 'Manuel São Bento' are the next top reviewers with approximately 170 and 110 movie reviews.

## Modeling Approach

### Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering recommends movies based on their features rather than user interactions. We use TF-IDF vectorization to encode movie attributes and compute similarity using cosine similarity and linear kernel similarity.

**Implementation Steps:**\
1. **Feature Engineering**

-   Combine `genre_ids`, `cast_names`, and `watch_providers` into a single text feature.

2\. **TF-IDF Vectorization**

-   Convert text features into numerical vectors.

<!-- -->

-   Use `min_df=2` to filter out infrequent terms.

3\. **Computing Similarity**

-   Use cosine similarity for text-based similarity.

-   Integrate `rating_average` and `vote_count` with linear kernel similarity for better ranking.

4\. **Recommendation System**

-   Use fuzzy matching to correct user input.

<!-- -->

-   Retrieve and rank the most similar movies based on the similarity matrix.

    ![Cosine Similarity Recommendation Results](images/Screenshot%202025-03-14%20at%2013.42.54.png)![]()

### Collaborative Filtering

-   Explain the technique (e.g., matrix factorization with Surprise library or k-nearest neighbors).

-   Describe how user-item interactions are utilized.

### Evaluation

-   Describe performance metrics used (e.g., precision, recall, RMSE).

-   Provide results with brief interpretation.

## Results and Analysis

-   Highlight key findings from both models.

-   Compare the strengths and weaknesses of content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.

-   Discuss any challenges faced (e.g., cold start problem) and how you addressed them.

## Conclusion

-   Summarize the project's achievements.

-   Suggest potential improvements (e.g., hybrid models, enhanced data sources, or improved user interface).

-   Mention real-world applications or extensions of the system.
